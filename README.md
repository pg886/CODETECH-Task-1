**Project:** Tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users

**Objective** 
The objective of the password strength assessment tool is to guide users in creating secure passwords by evaluating their length, complexity, and uniqueness. It aims to enhance security by reducing the risk of password-related vulnerabilities and educating users on best practices for password creation. This tool ultimately promotes better password hygiene and strengthens overall system protection.

**Key Activities**
Key activities for the password strength assessment tool include:

1. **Password Analysis:** Evaluate the entered password based on length, complexity (use of varied character types), and uniqueness (avoidance of common patterns and dictionary words).
2. **Entropy Calculation:** Measure the unpredictability of the password to assess its resistance to brute force attacks.
3. **Real-Time Feedback:** Provide immediate feedback to users on password strength, offering suggestions for improvement if needed.
4. **Security Enhancement:** Regularly update the tool's criteria to reflect evolving cybersecurity threats and best practices.
